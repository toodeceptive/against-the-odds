### 2. Architecture & Design Patterns

- [ ] Assess adherence to SOLID principles
- [ ] Review design pattern usage
- [ ] Assess separation of concerns
- [ ] Review abstraction levels
- [ ] Assess coupling and cohesion
- [ ] Review architectural decisions

### 3. Code Smells & Technical Debt

- [ ] Identify code duplication
- [ ] Assess function/class complexity
- [ ] Review long functions/classes
- [ ] Identify magic numbers/strings
- [ ] Assess dead code and unused dependencies
- [ ] Review commented-out code

### 4. Error Handling

- [ ] Review error handling patterns
- [ ] Assess error message quality
- [ ] Review error propagation
- [ ] Assess error recovery strategies
- [ ] Review error logging
- [ ] Assess error handling consistency

### 5. Type Safety

- [ ] Assess TypeScript usage (if applicable)
- [ ] Review JSDoc/TSDoc coverage
- [ ] Assess type definitions
- [ ] Review type safety in function signatures
- [ ] Assess runtime type validation
- [ ] Review type inference opportunities

### 6. Naming & Conventions

- [ ] Review naming conventions consistency
- [ ] Assess variable/function naming clarity
- [ ] Review constant naming
- [ ] Assess file naming conventions
- [ ] Review code style consistency
- [ ] Assess naming across codebase

### 7. Code Documentation

- [ ] Review inline code comments
- [ ] Assess JSDoc/TSDoc coverage
- [ ] Review function documentation
- [ ] Assess class/module documentation
- [ ] Review complex logic explanations
- [ ] Assess documentation quality

## Deliverables

1. **Code Quality Audit Report** (`docs/expert-analyses/expert_03_code_quality_audit_YYYYMMDD.md`)
   - Code quality metrics
   - Architecture assessment
   - Technical debt inventory
   - Refactoring recommendations

2. **Refactoring Recommendations**
   - Critical refactorings (high impact)
   - Important refactorings (maintainability)
   - Nice-to-have refactorings (cleanup)

3. **Architecture Review**
   - Current architecture assessment
   - Architecture improvement recommendations
   - Design pattern suggestions
   - ADR (Architecture Decision Records)

4. **Code Quality Metrics**
   - Complexity metrics
   - Code coverage metrics
   - Technical debt score
   - Quality trends

## Execution Checklist
