## Execution Strategy

### Phase 1: Sequential Expert Execution

1. **Expert 1** (Security) → Establishes security baseline, removes vulnerabilities
2. **Expert 2** (Performance) → Optimizes performance, builds on secure foundation
3. **Expert 3** (Code Quality) → Improves code structure, builds on secure/performant base
4. **Expert 4** (Testing) → Ensures quality through tests, validates previous work
5. **Expert 5** (Documentation) → Documents all improvements, creates knowledge base
6. **Expert 6** (CI/CD) → Automates quality gates, ensures deployment safety
7. **Expert 7** (Integrations) → Optimizes external connections, validates security
8. **Expert 8** (Frontend) → Perfects user-facing code, ensures accessibility
9. **Expert 9** (Database) → Optimizes data layer, ensures data integrity
10. **Expert 10** (DevEx) → Perfects developer experience, ensures smooth workflows

### Phase 2: Cross-Expert Validation

- Each expert reviews and validates previous experts' work in their domain
- Identifies integration points and dependencies
- Ensures no conflicts or regressions
- Documents cross-domain considerations

### Phase 3: Integration & Synthesis

- Create master synthesis report combining all findings
- Identify cross-domain dependencies
- Create integrated improvement roadmap
- Final verification across all domains

## Quality Gates

Each expert must pass these gates before next expert begins:

1. ✅ **Audit Complete**: Comprehensive audit finished in assigned domain
2. ✅ **Issues Documented**: All findings documented with severity and recommendations
3. ✅ **Critical Fixes**: Critical issues fixed or remediation plan created
4. ✅ **Documentation Updated**: Domain documentation updated
5. ✅ **Tests Passing**: All existing tests pass (no regressions)
6. ✅ **Integration Validated**: Integration points with previous experts validated
7. ✅ **Report Generated**: Expert audit report created

## Usage Instructions

### To Execute a Single Expert Cycle:

```
Use the [Expert Name] prompt (prompts/expert-NN-domain.md) to:
1. Perform comprehensive audit in assigned domain
2. Document all findings
3. Implement critical fixes
4. Create audit report
5. Pass quality gates
6. Prepare for next expert
```

### To Execute Full 10-Expert System:

```
Execute experts sequentially:
1. Expert 1 (Security) → Complete audit, fix critical issues, generate report
2. Expert 2 (Performance) → Audit, optimize, validate Expert 1's work
3. Expert 3 (Code Quality) → Audit, refactor, validate previous experts
4. ... continue through Expert 10
5. Create master synthesis report
6. Final verification across all domains
```

### To Use Expert Prompts Independently:

Each expert prompt is self-contained and can be used independently for focused domain improvements.
