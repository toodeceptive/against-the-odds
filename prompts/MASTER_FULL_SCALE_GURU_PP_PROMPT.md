# Master full-scale guru PP prompt (perfected)

**Purpose**: User-approved directive for massive, full-scale multi-agent multi-cycle aligned comprehensive PP execution. Use as the canonical approval and scope for improvement, optimization, finalization, and completion of all work across the project.

**Reference**: [GURU_100_STEP_MULTIPHASE_PP_CYCLES_20260207.md](../docs/status/GURU_100_STEP_MULTIPHASE_PP_CYCLES_20260207.md), [OPERATOR_RUNBOOK.md](../OPERATOR_RUNBOOK.md), [GURU_PP_OPERATOR_GUIDE.md](../docs/GURU_PP_OPERATOR_GUIDE.md).

I approve you to **setup, run, execute, and perform** any and all tasks, work, automations, and steps required to:

- **Improve, enhance, optimize, finalize, and finish** all works and tasks
- **Identify and apply** optimizations, updates, cleaning, fixes, upgrades
- **Configure and optimize** extensions, Git, Cursor, settings, setups, repos, local files, code, environments
- Apply all **changes, commits, pushes, pulls** after **in-depth multi-faceted multi-agent guru expert team reviews**, with fixes and updates as needed

**Scope**: ALL trees, worktrees, branches, Git, GitHub, repos, and local assets.

## 2. Methods and techniques (pre-approved)

Use any and all of the following as needed:

- **Desktop automation** — tests and tooling per `tests/desktop-automation/` and scripts
- **E2E** — Playwright and full system tests where credentials/env allow
- **Actual, full system testing** — quality, verify-pipeline, unit, integration, desktop; fix any failure
- **Guru expert skills** — Prodigy Protocol (PP), agentic-performance, skills in `.cursor/skills/`
- **Multi-agent guru team** — assign roles per [GURU_20_TEAMS_60_SPECIALTIES.md](../docs/status/GURU_20_TEAMS_60_SPECIALTIES.md); run aligned PP cycles

## 3. Fix-if-fail rules (pre-approved)

| If this…                               | Do this…                                                                                                    |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Any test fails**                     | Fix the cause (code, config, or test); re-run until pass or document skip                                   |
| **CLI errors**                         | Fix the command, script, or environment; re-verify                                                          |
| **Settings/GitHub issues**             | Fix settings or GitHub config (browser, gh CLI, or API); document                                           |
| **APIs need setup**                    | Set up and configure; document in HANDOFF or CONSOLIDATION_LOG                                              |
| **Connections/extensions need config** | Configure and optimize; use CURSOR_UI_OPTIMIZATION_CHECKLIST if relevant                                    |
| **Not set up**                         | Set up manually or autonomously using guru expert multi-agent analysis, review, auditing, and deep research |

## 4. 100-step multiphase PP cycles (pre-approved)

Execute the **100-step multiphase series** of PP cycles for:

- Deep research, fixes, optimizations, reviewing, auditing, and finalizations
- Updating, enhancing, improving, upgrading, and automatically optimizing/cleaning/fixing **all aspects** of the project, functions, systems, pipeline
- Finishing all unfinished work and setups (manually and automatically as necessary)

**Plan**: [docs/status/GURU_100_STEP_MULTIPHASE_PP_CYCLES_20260207.md](../docs/status/GURU_100_STEP_MULTIPHASE_PP_CYCLES_20260207.md) — 10 phases × 10 steps (Repo/Git, Quality, Pipeline, Cursor, GitHub, Shopify, Tests, Docs, Cleanup, Finalize).

**Until**: ALL work is finished; if anything fails, fix it; if anything has errors, fix them; if anything is not set up, set it up using guru expert multi-agent analysis, review, auditing, and deep research.

## 5. Commit and push policy

- All commits and pushes from **primary** repo path only: `C:/Users/LegiT/against-the-odds`
- See [WORKTREE_INVENTORY.md](../docs/status/WORKTREE_INVENTORY.md) and [CONSOLIDATION_LOG.md](../docs/status/CONSOLIDATION_LOG.md) (path and commits note)
- After each phase (or batch): guru review → apply fixes → commit → push from primary
