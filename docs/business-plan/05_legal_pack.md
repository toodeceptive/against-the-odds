### 1) Returns window

We accept return requests within **`[RETURN_WINDOW_DAYS]` days** of delivery (based on carrier delivery confirmation), subject to the conditions below.

### 2) Return conditions (eligibility)

To be eligible for a return:

- Items must be **unused/unworn**, in **original condition**, with **original tags/packaging** (if applicable).
- Items must not be washed, altered, or damaged after delivery (except for manufacturing defects).

**Non-returnable items (if applicable)**: `[NON_RETURNABLE_ITEMS]` (e.g., final sale items, gift cards). If you don’t have non-returnables, delete this line.

### 3) How to start a return

Email `[SUPPORT_EMAIL]` with:

- Order number
- Item(s) you want to return (size/color)
- Reason for return
- Photos if the item is defective/damaged

We will reply with return instructions and, if applicable, a return label or address.

### 4) Return shipping costs

Choose and complete one option (delete the other):

- **Option A (customer-paid)**: Return shipping is paid by the customer unless the item is defective or we made an error.
- **Option B (store-paid)**: We provide a return label for eligible returns within the return window.

### 5) Exchanges

Choose your approach (delete what you don’t use):

- **We do not offer direct exchanges**. If you want a different size/color, return the original item (if eligible) and place a new order.
- **We offer exchanges** for `[EXCHANGE_ELIGIBILITY]` (e.g., size exchanges) subject to inventory availability.

### 6) Refunds

Once we receive and inspect the returned item, we will notify you of approval or rejection. If approved:

- Refunds are issued to the **original payment method**.
- Processing time: `[REFUND_PROCESSING_TIME_BUSINESS_DAYS]` business days after approval.

Note: Your bank/payment provider may take additional time to post the refund.

### 7) Damaged, defective, or wrong items

If your item arrives damaged/defective or you received the wrong item, contact `[SUPPORT_EMAIL]` within `[DEFECT_REPORT_WINDOW_DAYS]` days of delivery with photos and your order number. We will provide a resolution (replacement, refund, or other), depending on the situation and inventory.

### 8) Cancellations and address changes (time-sensitive)

Requests are time-sensitive:

- **Address changes**: only before the shipping label is purchased / shipment is handed to the carrier.
- **Cancellations**: only before fulfillment begins.

### 9) Chargebacks

Please contact us first so we can resolve the issue. Filing a chargeback may delay resolution and can limit our ability to offer alternate remedies.

### 10) Mandatory consumer rights

Some jurisdictions provide non-waivable consumer rights (e.g., returns for defective goods). Nothing in this policy limits your mandatory rights under applicable law.

## IP / Brand Protection Checklist

This is an operational checklist to reduce brand/IP risk. It is not legal advice.

### Brand assets and ownership hygiene

- [ ] Maintain a single source of truth for brand assets (logo files, wordmark, fonts, color palette): `[BRAND_ASSETS_LOCATION]`.
- [ ] Confirm licenses for any third-party fonts, photos, icons, and design assets used in marketing/site/theme.
- [ ] Keep a record of who created what (contracts, invoices, work-for-hire terms as applicable).

### Trademark and naming (jurisdiction-dependent)

- [ ] Identify core marks: `[BRAND_NAME]`, slogans, key product names.
- [ ] Perform a basic clearance search before heavy spend (search engines + social handles + relevant registries).
  - **Assumption**: You will consult counsel for formal clearance and filings in target markets.
- [ ] Secure handles and domains (including common misspellings): `[DOMAINS_AND_HANDLES_LIST]`.

### Copyright and content

- [ ] Ensure product photography and creative content are owned/licensed for commercial use.
- [ ] Maintain release/consent records for any models/creators: `[MODEL_RELEASES_LOCATION]`.
- [ ] Add site footer copyright notice with the current year and legal entity.

### Counterfeit/impersonation monitoring

- [ ] Set up periodic searches for `[BRAND_NAME]` on major marketplaces and social platforms.
- [ ] Create a lightweight enforcement playbook:
  - evidence to collect (screenshots, URLs, order IDs)
  - escalation owner: `[IP_ENFORCEMENT_OWNER]`
  - takedown request template (platform-specific; avoid asserting legal conclusions without counsel)

### DMCA / notice-and-takedown (optional; jurisdiction-specific)

- [ ] If operating in jurisdictions with notice-and-takedown procedures, prepare templates for submitting infringement claims to platforms.
  - Label this section explicitly with your jurisdiction assumptions and have counsel review.

### Product IP (if applicable)

- [ ] If designs are unique (prints/patterns), keep dated source files and proofs of creation.
- [ ] If using manufacturer-provided artwork, confirm licensing/assignment terms.

## Risk Register

This register is operational: it ties risks to signals, mitigations, and accountable owners.

### Top risks & mitigations (one-page view)

- **Policy contradictions (ToS/Privacy/Shipping/Returns)**: Keep Shopify policy pages and support macros aligned; review quarterly and after any policy change.
- **Fraud/chargebacks**: Use fraud screening + clear shipping/returns communications; respond quickly to disputes with evidence.
- **Customer data exposure**: Enforce secrets hygiene, least privilege, and incident playbooks; minimize data stored; document notification steps by jurisdiction.
- **Shipping delays/lost packages**: Publish realistic estimates; define escalation windows and consistent resolution paths.
- **IP/counterfeit/impersonation**: Asset ownership hygiene + ongoing marketplace monitoring + takedown workflow.
