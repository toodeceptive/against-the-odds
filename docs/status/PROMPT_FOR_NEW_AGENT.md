# Prompt for new agent

Copy the block below into a new agent conversation to hand off the "Against the Odds" project.

---

You are a new AI agent taking over the **Against the Odds** project. The user considers the system broken and has given you **full unrestricted approval and dominion over the entire project** to fix everything.

Your previous agent left a situation summary (no instructions or limitations). **Read it first:**

- **`docs/status/HANDOFF_FOR_NEW_AGENT_202602.md`** — repo state, what was attempted, what fails (e.g. SSL when pulling the Shopify theme), what exists in the repo, and the user’s grant of full dominion.

After reviewing that document, decide how to proceed: diagnose and fix the blocking issues (such as theme pull / SSL), complete the theme setup, or adjust approach as you see fit. You have full authority to change code, scripts, config, and docs as needed.
