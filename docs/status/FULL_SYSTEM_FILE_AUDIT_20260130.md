# Full system file audit (2026-01-30)

**Purpose**: Legacy reference. File inventory and codebase layout were consolidated; use the following as the single source of truth.

---

## Where to go

- **Root and file index**: [ROOT_FILES_INVENTORY.md](ROOT_FILES_INVENTORY.md), [INDEX_REPORTS.md](INDEX_REPORTS.md)
- **Codebase layout, scripts, tests**: [CODEBASE_AUDIT_20260131.md](CODEBASE_AUDIT_20260131.md)
- **Plans and structure**: `.cursor/plans/FINAL_REPO_ORGANIZATION_AND_AUDIT.plan.md`

This file was removed in a docs cleanup and recreated as a pointer so existing references (e.g. from the canonical plan) resolve.
