# Audit: Prompts & Agents (A6) — 2026-01-30

- **Decision tree**: AGENT_PROMPT_DECISION_TREE.md lists Full project perfection and Full project update & perfection; Phase 0 gate; which prompt when. Accurate.
- **Master prompts**: Five exist (head-guru, MASTER_10, AO_GURU_MULTI_SPECIALIST, ULTIMATE_MASTER, ULTIMATE_COMPREHENSIVE). Decision tree directs to specific goals; no file deletion (C5).
- **finalization-shopify-store-ops.md**: Does not mention preview → pending-approval → open-pending-approval → approve → deploy-log. Add one line in B7.
- **head-guru-orchestrator**: Verify workflow line in B7. PERFECT_EXECUTION_PROMPT and PLAN_AGENT_ENTRY unchanged in substance.
