# Conversation and decision audit

**Purpose**: Single source for conversation history and binding decisions. (Legacy filename kept for references; content consolidated.)

---

## Where to go

- **Chronological log of all work and decisions**: [CONSOLIDATION_LOG.md](CONSOLIDATION_LOG.md)
- **Binding execution rules**: [EXECUTIVE_DECISION_WORK_PRINCIPLES.md](EXECUTIVE_DECISION_WORK_PRINCIPLES.md)
- **Current state for new agent**: [HANDOFF_FOR_NEW_AGENT_202602.md](HANDOFF_FOR_NEW_AGENT_202602.md)

Authority for future work is derived from CONSOLIDATION_LOG and handoff docs; only incremental, non-redundant work per EXECUTIVE_DECISION_WORK_PRINCIPLES.
