# AO Drop 01 — Multi-Product Image + Print Plan (4 Products, 2 Manufacturers)

## Goal

Produce **final print-ready artwork + mockups** for Drop 01 across **4 products** (beanie, fitted flatbrim cap, hoodie, long sleeve shirt) to order **1 sample of each from 2 manufacturers** and compare:

- print quality + durability
- placement accuracy
- blank quality + fit
- turnaround time
- consistency across products

---

## Product Overview

### Products Ordered

1. **Beanie** — 1 sample from each manufacturer (2 total)
2. **Fitted Flatbrim Cap** — 1 sample from each manufacturer (2 total)
3. **Hoodie** — 1 sample from each manufacturer (2 total)
4. **Long Sleeve Shirt** — 1 sample from each manufacturer (2 total)

### Sample Size Standardization

**Recommendation**: Standardize on **L** (Large) for all products to ensure consistent comparison across manufacturers.

**Alternative**: Use manufacturer's "standard" size if L is not available, but document the exact size used per manufacturer.

## Product 3: Hoodie

### Garment Baseline

- **Product**: Blank hoodie (black)
- **Sample size**: L
- **Decoration method target**:
  - **Front/back**: Screen print or DTG (manufacturer recommendation)
  - **Sleeve** (AO + QR + spray overlay): Screen print (multi-layer) or DTG

### Design Placements

#### 1) Front — "Against the Odds" final logo

- **Location**: Center chest
- **Approx print size**: 10–12 in wide (25–30.5 cm), scaled to fit chest
- **Color**: Per final logo spec (define in the spec pack)
- **Deliverable**: Vector + transparent PNG

#### 2) Back — Slogan "The Odds Were Never Even"

- **Location**: Upper back or full back (choose one and keep consistent)
  - Option A (recommended): **Upper back**, 2–3 in below collar seam
  - Option B: **Full back**, centered
- **Approx size**:
  - Upper back: 10–12 in wide
  - Full back: 12–14 in wide
- **Typography**: Final font choice included in vector (text outlined)

#### 3) Right Sleeve — AO 2-letter logo + QR, "spray paint hidden"

**Requirement**: QR must be **operational** (scannable) while **subtle** (partially obscured by spray paint).

- **Location**: Right sleeve outer side, between shoulder seam and mid-forearm
- **Base layer**: "AO" 2-letter logo
- **Overlay**: QR code placed **over the AO logo**
- **Mask/finish**: Spray paint layer placed over QR (and some of AO), creating a "revealed but gritty" effect

##### QR Code Requirements (so it stays scannable)

- **Error correction**: **H** (high)
- **Minimum physical size**: Start at **1.25–1.5 in** (3.2–3.8 cm) square
- **Quiet zone**: Keep a clean margin around the QR (at least **4 modules**) — do *not* spray/texture the quiet zone
- **Contrast**: QR "dark modules" should remain clearly darker than the hoodie fabric; avoid low-contrast grays
- **Testing**:
  - Test scan on at least 2 phones (iPhone/Android) at 12–24 inches distance
  - Test after applying the spray overlay in the mockup/art file

##### "Spray Paint Hide" Strategy (practical)

- Spray effect should obscure **~15–35%** of QR modules (not the quiet zone), relying on error correction H.
- Prefer a spray texture that blocks **clusters** rather than thin haze (thin haze reduces contrast and can break scans).
- Keep at least **one full finder pattern** (the big corner squares) fully clear; ideally keep all 3 mostly intact.

##### QR Destination (decide once; keep consistent)

- Recommended: `https://aodrop.com` or a dedicated landing page like `https://aodrop.com/scan`
- If you want manufacturer-specific tracking, encode the same URL but use **UTM params** per manufacturer in the QR (optional).

### Deliverables

- Vector files: front logo, back slogan, sleeve AO+QR+spray overlay
- Raster previews: transparent PNGs at 300 DPI
- Mockups: front, back, right sleeve close-up
- Spec sheet with exact dimensions and placement measurements

## QR Code Strategy (Cross-Product)

### Destination URL

**Primary**: `https://aodrop.com/scan` (dedicated landing page)

**Alternative**: `https://aodrop.com` (homepage)

### Tracking Approach

**Option A (Recommended)**: Same URL for all products, track via landing page analytics

**Option B**: UTM parameters per manufacturer:

- Manufacturer 1: `https://aodrop.com/scan?utm_source=manufacturer1&utm_medium=merch&utm_campaign=drop01`
- Manufacturer 2: `https://aodrop.com/scan?utm_source=manufacturer2&utm_medium=merch&utm_campaign=drop01`

**Option C**: UTM parameters per product:

- Beanie: `?utm_source=merch&utm_medium=beanie&utm_campaign=drop01`
- Cap: `?utm_source=merch&utm_medium=cap&utm_campaign=drop01`
- Hoodie: `?utm_source=merch&utm_medium=hoodie&utm_campaign=drop01`
- Long Sleeve: `?utm_source=merch&utm_medium=longsleeve&utm_campaign=drop01`

**Recommendation**: Use Option A for simplicity, or Option B if you want to compare manufacturer effectiveness.

## Workflow (Fastest Path)

### Step A — Gather Base Images

For each product, obtain blank garment photos:

1. **Beanie**: Front view showing cuff
2. **Cap**: Front, side, back views
3. **Hoodie**: Front, back, right sleeve views
4. **Long Sleeve**: Front, back, left sleeve views

**Sources**:

- Manufacturer blank photos (preferred)
- Existing mockups in repo (if available)
- Stock photos (as last resort)

### Step B — Build Layered Artwork

For each product and placement, create layered artwork (recommended tool: Figma/Photoshop/Photopea):

**Layers**:

- Base garment image
- Placement guide (seams, centerlines, measurement markers)
- Artwork layer(s) (logo, slogan, etc.)
- QR layer (if applicable)
- Spray overlay layer (if applicable)

### Step C — Validate QR Codes

1. Export QR designs at final size
2. Print on paper at scale
3. Scan with multiple phones (iPhone/Android) at 12–24 inches distance
4. Adjust spray mask/overlay until QR scans reliably while maintaining "hidden" aesthetic
5. Document successful scan distance and conditions

### Step D — Create Spec Sheets

For each product:

1. Create spec sheet PDF with all requirements listed above
2. Include mockup image on spec sheet
3. Add manufacturer confirmation checklist

### Step E — Package for Manufacturers

Send each manufacturer (1 sample of each product):

**Package contents**:

- Master spec pack overview (explaining 4 products, 1 sample each)
- Per-product spec sheet PDFs (beanie, cap, hoodie, longsleeve)
- Vector files (organized by product)
- PNG previews (organized by product)
- Mockups (all products)

**Manufacturer confirmation checklist** (include in package):

- [ ] Print method recommendation per product
- [ ] Exact placement measurements they will use
- [ ] Proof approval step before production
- [ ] Estimated turnaround time
- [ ] Cost per sample
- [ ] Minimum order quantities (for future production)

---

## Acceptance Criteria (Before Ordering Samples)

### Artwork & Mockups

- [ ] All mockups look correct on blank garment images
- [ ] All QR codes scan reliably in real-world conditions (printed test)
- [ ] All spec sheets are complete and clear
- [ ] Vector files are properly formatted (text outlined, correct artboards)

### Manufacturer Alignment

- [ ] Both manufacturers have acknowledged the same placement + size specs
- [ ] Both manufacturers have confirmed they can execute all placements
- [ ] Both manufacturers have provided cost estimates
- [ ] Both manufacturers have confirmed turnaround times

### Quality Assurance

- [ ] QR codes tested on multiple devices (iPhone + Android)
- [ ] Spray overlay effect maintains QR scannability
- [ ] Color specifications are clear and consistent
- [ ] Placement measurements are precise and unambiguous

---

## Next Steps After Samples Arrive

1. **Compare samples**:
   - Print quality (sharpness, color accuracy, durability)
   - Placement accuracy (measure actual vs spec)
   - Blank quality (fabric, fit, construction)
   - QR code functionality (scan test on actual garments)

2. **Document findings**:
   - Create comparison matrix (manufacturer 1 vs manufacturer 2)
   - Note any deviations from spec
   - Rate overall quality (1–5 scale)

3. **Select manufacturer** for production run

4. **Order production quantities** based on selected manufacturer

---

## Notes

- **Embroidery vs Screen Print**: Embroidery is preferred for beanie and cap front panels for durability, but screen print may be more cost-effective. Discuss with manufacturers.
- **QR Code Size**: Smaller QR codes (beanie, cap) may require higher error correction or simpler spray overlay to maintain scannability.
- **Color Consistency**: Ensure logo colors are consistent across all products (use Pantone references if possible).
- **Future Production**: After samples are approved, prepare production-ready artwork and bulk order specifications.
