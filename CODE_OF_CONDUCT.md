# Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the following code of conduct.  We expect all participants to abide by this code in all project spaces and communications.

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment‑free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behaviour that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behaviour include:

* The use of sexualised language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behaviour and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behaviour.

## Scope

This code of conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behaviour may be reported by contacting the project team at the email address listed in the repository’s metadata.  All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.  The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.  If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, the maintainers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from the project and community.
