# Proceed P1 Execution — 2026-01-30

**Context**: User said "proceed"; P1 recommendations from `docs/status/GURU_MULTI_AGENT_AUDIT_REPORT_20260130.md` were executed.

---

## Completed (P1)

1. **INDEX_REPORTS.md**  
   Created `docs/status/INDEX_REPORTS.md`: index of root-level reports, docs/status files, and archive. Lists "keep at root" (README, CHANGELOG, NEXT_STEPS, OPERATOR_RUNBOOK), legacy root files, and docs/status current/recent files.

2. **Root report consolidation**  
   Created `archive/2026-01-30/` and `ARCHIVE_NOTE.md`. Moved 13 legacy reports from root to archive: COMPLETION_REPORT, FIXES_COMPLETE, FIXED_STATUS, IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE, IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS, PHASE_1_AUDIT_SUMMARY, PHASE_1_EXECUTION_STATUS, FINAL_VERIFICATION, PROJECT_STATUS, PROJECT_STATUS_FINAL, REPOSITORY_STATUS, REVIEW_SUMMARY, SUB_ISSUES.

3. **Deploy and backup-store placeholders**
   - `deploy.yml`: Added top comment: "PLACEHOLDER: No real deployment steps yet. Implement per OPERATOR_RUNBOOK.md and docs/launch/00_launch_checklist.md when ready. Shopify theme deployment: use sync-theme-branch.yml + Shopify Connect from GitHub."
   - `shopify-sync.yml`: Added comment above backup-store job: "PLACEHOLDER: Implement real backup (e.g. theme/product export to artifact) per OPERATOR_RUNBOOK.md / docs/launch/00_launch_checklist.md."

4. **agent-context.md**  
   Updated `prompts/agent-context.md` project structure: added `src/shopify/` and `themes/aodrop-theme/` so agents see Shopify theme location.

## Next (P2 or other)

- P2 from audit: sync-products.ps1 load .env.local when present; document "run from repo root" for tasks; script portability (hardcoded repo path).
- Immediate: ensure .env.local has Shopify creds and run `.\scripts\shopify\test-connection.ps1`; continue with launch checklist and NEXT_STEPS.
