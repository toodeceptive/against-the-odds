# Proceed Execution — 2026-01-30

**Context**: User requested "proceed" after Phase 0 sign-off. Workspace: primary repo `c:\Users\LegiT\against-the-odds`.

---

## Completed

- **Verification (this workspace)**
  - `.\scripts\debug\parse-all-ps1.ps1`: 59 scripts parsed, 0 errors.
  - `npm run lint`: passed (0 errors, 0 warnings).
- **Phase 0**: Already signed off in `docs/status/PHASE_0_FINALIZATION.md` (“Phase 0 finalized; proceeding allowed.”).
- **Shopify test script**: `scripts/shopify/test-connection.ps1` now loads `.env.local` into the process when present (same pattern as `run-runbook.ps1`), so running the script from repo root uses local credentials when the file exists.

---

## Immediate next step (blocker)

**Shopify connection test** still fails with: `SHOPIFY_STORE_DOMAIN not set`.

- `.env.local` exists in repo root but does not (yet) set real values for Shopify, or they are placeholders.
- **Action**: In repo root, ensure `.env.local` contains at least:
  - `SHOPIFY_STORE_DOMAIN=aodrop.com` (or your store’s `.myshopify.com` domain)
  - `SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN=<Admin API access token>`
- Then run: `.\scripts\shopify\test-connection.ps1`
- Credentials: see `docs/CREDENTIALS_SETUP.md` and Shopify Admin → Apps → Development → Custom apps.

## After Shopify test passes

- Continue with `docs/launch/00_launch_checklist.md` and `NEXT_STEPS.md`: theme dev, merch ordering prep, Drop 1 product image plan (`docs/launch/07_drop01_product_image_plan_extended.md`), etc.
- Optional: run full runbook: `.\scripts\run-runbook.ps1` (loads `.env.local` and runs Shopify + GitHub checks).
