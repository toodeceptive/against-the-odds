**Purpose**: Legacy report/status markdown files moved from repo root during P1 consolidation (see `docs/status/GURU_MULTI_AGENT_AUDIT_REPORT_20260130.md` and `docs/status/INDEX_REPORTS.md`).

**Contents**: Historical implementation, phase, fix, and status reports. Phase 4 (2026-01-30) added: AUDIT_REPORT, BUG_FIXES, CODE_REVIEW_SYNC, DESKTOP_AUTOMATION_IMPLEMENTATION, FINAL_IMPLEMENTATION_*, INSTALL_INSTRUCTIONS, MASTER_EXECUTION_REPORT, QUICK_START, SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS, SETUP_VERIFICATION, SYSTEM_READY, ULTIMATE_MASTER_AGENT_EXECUTION_REPORT. Kept for reference; current status and agent entry live in `docs/status/` and root canonical files (README, CHANGELOG, NEXT_STEPS, OPERATOR_RUNBOOK).

**Do not delete** without checking INDEX_REPORTS and that no critical references point here.
