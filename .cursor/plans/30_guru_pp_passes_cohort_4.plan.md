## Master consolidation (post-Cohort 4)

After all four cohorts complete:

1. **Merge**: Apply findings from 120 passes (Cohorts 1–4) into [ao_agent_pp_prompt_conversion.plan.md](ao_agent_pp_prompt_conversion.plan.md).
2. **Conflict resolution**: Use Pass 69 (Cohort 3) and Pass 86 (Cohort 3) plus Pass 119 (Cohort 4) for change impact.
3. **Sign-off**: Pass 120 (Final Sign-Off) gates execution.
4. **Output**: Single master plan V7; archive cohort meta-plans; CHANGELOG and consolidation log.
