# Plans index (repo)

This repo intentionally keeps **one canonical plan file**:

- **Canonical plan**: `FINAL_REPO_ORGANIZATION_AND_AUDIT.plan.md` (open in Cursor and use Build)

## Notes on prior plan references

Older audits and status docs may reference plan files that **no longer exist** (they were consolidated and removed), such as:

- `cursor-github-shopify-pipeline.plan.md`
- `expert_team_security_and_platform_plan_*.plan.md`
- `full_project_update_perfection_guru.plan.md`

If you see those references, treat them as **implemented or consolidated**. The current authoritative plan content is in `FINAL_REPO_ORGANIZATION_AND_AUDIT.plan.md`, and the current operational workflows are documented in:

- `docs/status/PLAN_AGENT_ENTRY.md`
- `docs/status/CONSOLIDATION_LOG.md`
- `docs/status/INDEX_REPORTS.md`
- `docs/AGENT_WORKFLOW_CURSOR_SHOPIFY.md`
