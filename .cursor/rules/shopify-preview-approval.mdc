# Shopify: Preview before apply

For any change that affects the **live Shopify store** (theme push, product sync, publishing):

1. **Preview first**: Show the user one of:
   - Product sync: output of `.\scripts\shopify\sync-products.ps1 -DryRun`
   - Theme: `shopify theme dev` preview URL, or a PR diff summary
2. **Snapshot**: Before asking for approval, write the preview to [docs/status/pending-approval.md](docs/status/pending-approval.md) (summary + dry-run output or theme URL/diff + "To approve: say 'approve' in Cursor chat"). **Then run `.\scripts\open-pending-approval.ps1`** from repo root so the file opens in Cursor automatically—the user sees the preview without any action. For **theme/page changes**, also run `.\scripts\start-theme-preview.ps1` so the theme dev server starts in a new window and the preview URL opens in their browser automatically. Tell the user: "I've opened the pending changes for you [and started the live theme preview in your browser]. When ready, say 'approve' in this chat."
3. **Get explicit approval**: Wait for the user to confirm in chat (e.g. "approve", "yes", "looks good") before:
   - Running sync without `-DryRun`
   - Pushing to `main` or merging a PR that updates theme/products
   - Running `shopify theme push` or any script that writes to the live store
4. **After apply**: Every store-affecting change (theme push, product sync, one-off browser change) must have a deploy-log entry. Append to [docs/status/deploy-log.md](docs/status/deploy-log.md): timestamp, action, branch/commit, summary, rollback steps (e.g. revert commit, restore JSON and sync, or "Revert in Shopify Admin: …"). Clear [docs/status/pending-approval.md](docs/status/pending-approval.md) (write "No pending changes" placeholder). Do not include secrets in the log.

Never perform permanent store or branch updates without preview and user approval. See [docs/AGENT_WORKFLOW_CURSOR_SHOPIFY.md](docs/AGENT_WORKFLOW_CURSOR_SHOPIFY.md).
