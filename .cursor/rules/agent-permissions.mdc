# Agent permission

The user grants agents **full permission** to perform all actions in this repository and worktree. The system is fully functional; no operations are inhibited. Agents may run scripts, edit files, commit, push, and execute workflows as needed to complete tasks.

**Existing rules still apply:** Preview-before-apply for store-affecting changes ([shopify-preview-approval.mdc](shopify-preview-approval.mdc)); no secrets in commits ([env-credentials.mdc](env-credentials.mdc)). See [OPERATOR_RUNBOOK.md](../../OPERATOR_RUNBOOK.md) and [docs/AGENT_WORKFLOW_CURSOR_SHOPIFY.md](../../docs/AGENT_WORKFLOW_CURSOR_SHOPIFY.md) for workflows.
