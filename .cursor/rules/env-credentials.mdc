# Credentials: Permanent and Secure

- **Single source of truth**: All secrets (Shopify, GitHub, etc.) live in **`.env.local`** in the repo root. This file is gitignored and must never be committed.
- **Setup**: The agent may read and write `.env.local` only to complete credential setup (e.g. after browser login, token extraction, or when the user provides values). Use repo scripts such as `scripts/shopify/browser/save-token-to-env.ps1` when appropriate.
- **Never**: Commit `.env.local` or any file containing real tokens, passwords, or API keys. Never log, echo, or include secrets in prompts, docs, or code.
- **Verify**: After updating credentials, run `.\scripts\run-runbook.ps1` to confirm Shopify and GitHub connectivity.

See: `docs/CREDENTIALS_SETUP.md`, `docs/BROWSER_CREDENTIAL_FLOW.md`.
