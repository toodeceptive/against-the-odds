# AO Drop 01 — Assets Workspace

Store Drop 01 working files here **if** you want them versioned. If you prefer to keep large binaries out of git, keep only small exports + specs here and store originals externally.

Recommended structure:

```
assets/drop01/
  spec-pack/
    drop01_print_spec_sheet.pdf
  artwork/
    front_against_the_odds_logo.(ai|pdf|svg)
    back_the_odds_were_never_even.(ai|pdf|svg)
    sleeve_ao_qr_spray.(ai|pdf|svg)
  exports/
    front.png
    back.png
    sleeve.png
  mockups/
    hoodie_front_mockup.png
    hoodie_back_mockup.png
    hoodie_right_sleeve_mockup.png
```
