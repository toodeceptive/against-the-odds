# Ready to Send — Drop 01 (2 Manufacturers)

Use this checklist before sending a spec pack to each manufacturer.

## Per manufacturer

- [ ] **PDFs**: Master spec sheet + per-product spec (beanie, cap, hoodie, long sleeve) exported from `spec-pack/` and named per plan (e.g. `beanie_spec.pdf`, `cap_spec.pdf`, `hoodie_spec.pdf`, `longsleeve_spec.pdf`).
- [ ] **PNGs**: Print-ready artwork at 300 DPI for each placement (front, back, sleeve, etc.) in `exports/` or as agreed.
- [ ] **QR**: If applicable, QR destination URL and (optional) UTM per manufacturer confirmed; artwork includes correct QR.
- [ ] **Mockups**: Final mockups in `mockups/` attached or linked for approval.
- [ ] **Samples**: Order is for **1 sample** of each of the 4 products (beanie, cap, hoodie, long sleeve).

## Before sending

- [ ] All placeholders in spec templates filled (brand, contact, sizes, colors, quantities).
- [ ] Artwork matches spec (logo size, placement, stitch vs patch, etc.) per `docs/launch/07_drop01_product_image_plan_extended.md`.

## After sending

- [ ] Track which manufacturer received which pack and sample request.
- [ ] Record delivery and sample ETA for comparison.
